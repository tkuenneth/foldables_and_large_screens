This project is a Kotlin Multiplatform reimplementation of the *MaterialAdaptiveDemo*, which is Android-only. It is a mostly unaltered from what the [Kotlin Multiplatform Wizard](https://kmp.jetbrains.com) creates, just a few library updates and additions, and, of course, the composables that showcase Material 3 Adaptive.
