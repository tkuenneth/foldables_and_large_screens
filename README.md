# Foldables and large screens

This repo contains samples for large screen and foldable support on Android and Compose Multiplatform

### MaterialAdaptiveDemo and MaterialAdaptiveMultiplatformDemo

These projects implement the same functionality; the first one is Android-only, whereas the latter one uses Compose Multiplatform. The code is largely the same, differences relate to a few features not yet being available on Compose Multiplatform.

### Slides

The `slides` folder contains PDF versions of slides from some of my talks about foldables and large screens.
